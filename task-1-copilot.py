### Analysis

#The AI-suggested code leverages Python’s built-in `sorted()` function with a lambda function as the key. This approach is concise, readable, and highly efficient, as `sorted()` uses Timsort, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). It also does not modify the original list, returning a new sorted list instead.

#The manual implementation uses a selection sort algorithm, which is much less efficient, with a time complexity of O(n²). While it demonstrates the sorting logic explicitly, it is more verbose and less practical for large datasets. Additionally, it sorts the list in place, which may not always be desirable.

#In summary, the AI-suggested version is more efficient and preferable for real-world applications due to its optimal time complexity, simplicity, and use of Pythonic conventions. The manual version is useful for educational purposes but should be avoided in production code where performance matters. The AI tool’s suggestion aligns with best practices and demonstrates the advantage of leveraging built-in language features.
